a) Preparation for the regression:
	Dummy Variables for each class
	* Reorder of the columns so CityMPG, HwyMPG and Class are contiguous
	
b) Results in $K$30 cell

c) Regression Equation: $ \hat y = -3.239 - 0.27 * CityMPG + 0.499 * HwyMPG + 0.202 * Class $

d)The sign of a regression coefficient tells you whether there is a positive or negative correlation between each independent variable the dependent variable. 
A positive coefficient indicates that as the value of the independent variable increases, the mean of the dependent variable also tends to increase.
A negative coefficient suggests that as the independent variable increases, the dependent variable tends to decrease.
So this means that HwyMPG has larger contribution to the change of $ \hat y $ than CityMPG and Class

e) Check solution for exercise1

f) Multiple R equals to 0.914
This means that our multiple linear regression fits the data well!

g) R-squared(0.83) is pretty close to zero and has a direct connection to Multiple R.
It is a verification on how good the model fits our data.
