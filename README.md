# Problem Solving Environments for Data Science Applications (ce514)

This course introduces problem solving environments including Python, R, Julia, SaS, JMP, and Excel for applications in the domain of Data Science.

The weekly labs and projects train us on:
- **regression, classification and clustering techniques for big data**
- **solving nonlinear optimization problems with classical, stochastic, and genetic algorithms using well known libraries like sci-kit learn, pandas, numpy, qurobi**
