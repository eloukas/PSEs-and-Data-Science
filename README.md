# PSEs and Data Science (ce514)

This course introduces problem solving environments including Python, R, Julia, SaS, JMP, and Excel.
It trains us as undergraduate students to use them to apply least squares and regression techniques for big data,
to solve nonlinear optimization problems with classical, stochastic, and genetic algorithms using
well known libraries like qurobi library and Argonne Optimization Server, and data mining problems.
