# Project 4

This file contains a python notebook for logistic regression with gradient descent and a pdf file discussing the optimization method gradient descent and an example in R. 

We are supposed to run the python notebook with another data set of categorical data, implement the R example and run it on the same dataset.

The dataset we use is The Wine Dataset from the Official UCI Machine Learning Repository
(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine)

We import it like this :
```
from sklearn import datasets
data = datasets.load_wine()
```
